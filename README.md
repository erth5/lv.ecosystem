Collection on Addons they can be installed in Laravel Projects

over 7700 files, so create it local itself:

````
composer create-project laravel/<name>
````

posssible addons:
* breeze
* cashier
* horizon
* jetstream
* octane
* socialite
* telescope
* valet

For Simples, I have entered the following into the terminal:

````
composer create-project laravel/breeze
composer create-project laravel/cashier
composer create-project laravel/horizon
composer create-project laravel/jetstream
composer create-project laravel/octane
composer create-project laravel/socialite
composer create-project laravel/telescope
composer create-project laravel/valet
````

,but ALL Addons must be installed in a previously created Laravel-Project to be functionable !
